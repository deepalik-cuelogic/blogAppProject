 	"blogContent" :"<p>Researchers at&nbsp;Hong Kong Baptist University&nbsp;have developed a smartphone app that can detect drowsy drivers and alert them.</p><p>The new approach adopts a smartphone&#39;s real-time video to track and analyse the facial features of a driver, in particular the changes in his eyelids and head position, which are prominent fatigue symptoms.&nbsp;<br /><br />With this system pre-installed in a generic smartphone, a driver just has to put it near the steering wheel with the front camera facing him in his normal driving position.&nbsp;</p><p>When the camera captures features like drooping eyelids, drowsiness or even nodding off, an alarm is automatically set off.&nbsp;<br /><br />To ensure that the driver is awakened, the driver has to turn off the alarm either by voice or by hand.&nbsp;<br /><br />This method requires only a smartphone without any additional devices or sensors, Professor Cheung Yiu-ming said in a statement released by the Hong Kong Baptist University.&nbsp;</p>"
